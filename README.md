# C-attle Footprint 
An interactive realtime visual tool to track, assess, and estimate greenhouse gas emissions and visualize our carbon footprint

**The Problem**

Greenhouse gases produced from man-made activities are being released into the atmosphere at an increasing rate each year
Scientists and Policy-makers need to be informed on how human activities are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions
While datasets exist for certain gas emissions and natural disasters, there is no one-stop solution for visualizing all this


**The Solution**

An interactive web application that tracks and visualizes GHG emissions
Land use drivers ( such as human settlement, topography, land cover), power plants, and fire datasets coupled with GHG emission data and fire data informs policy makers on legislative decisions relating fund allocation/land development

**App Details**

The app is developed using:
- Google Earth Engine hosted web application
- Configurable Map visualizations for different GHG emissions and sources 
- JavaScript API for scripting
- On-the-fly geospatial calculations


The main_gee.js file needs to be run in the code editor of Google Earth Engine Javascript API (https://code.earthengine.google.com/)
